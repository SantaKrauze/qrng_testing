## QRNG 
***
# Utilities for testing binary files generated by a quantum generator, along with sample QRNG files. 
***
Quantum generated numbers are provided in qrng folder containing 10MB files and a 100MB file (binary .dat files). Files provided pass all statistical tests.
***
The goal is to be able to test binary files as unif01 generators in TestU01.
**
randStrMerge.py is used to generate xor-shifted files from two quantum files, with given correlation lenght (shift).
